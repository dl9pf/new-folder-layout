# The following might be necessary when multiple/split surfaces are created.
# Without this, QtWayland will sometimes maintain the same/old size even if the
# split surface is destroyed.
# We keep it disabled by default as it causes an additional repaint of the
# surface until the compositor sends a configure event to scale the window to
# the actual area. Typical windows will, by default, have an initial size set
# by qtwayland when starting-up (without an explicit size specified by the
# application).
# Note that QtWayland will only test the presence of the environment variable
# so it will be enabled even if set to 0
