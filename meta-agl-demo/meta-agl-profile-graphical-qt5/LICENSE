Different components of the AGL layers are under different licenses (a mix
of MIT and GPLv2). See LICENSE.GPL-2.0-only and LICENSE.MIT for further
details of the individual licenses.

All metadata (e.g. .bb, .bbappend, .bbclass, .inc, templates/* and similar)
is MIT licensed unless otherwise stated.
Source code included in tree for individual recipes (e.g. patches) are under
the LICENSE stated in the associated recipe (.bb file) unless otherwise stated.

License information for any other files (scripts) is either explicitly stated
or defaults to GPL version 2 only.

Individual files can contain the following style tags instead of the full
license text to identify their license:

    SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only
    SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

This enables machine processing of license information based on the SPDX
License Identifiers that are here available: http://spdx.org/licenses/
