Subject: [PATCH 006/122] arm64: dma: check parent bus restrictions in
 dma_capable()

It may happen that although hardware device is capable of full 64-bit
addressing in DMA operations, way device is connected to the system
imposes addressing limitations. Example: NVMe device connected to PCIe
host sitting on AXI bus with 32-bit addressing (and no iommu configured).

There is no agreement on setting dma_mask in this case. For low level,
dma_mask must be 32-bit - that's what hardware provides for software.
But for higher level, dma_mask must be 64-bit - that's what platform
(hardware + swiotlb) provides for higher levels.

dma_capable() is swiotlb's check if current address is DMAable by device
directly or swiotlb should provide bounce buffer for it. Using dma_mask
in dma_capable() assumes that dma_mask is set for low level - which does
not always match reality.

This patch changes dma_capable() to check additional restrictions.

It is a workaround against ambiguous dma_mask semantics.
