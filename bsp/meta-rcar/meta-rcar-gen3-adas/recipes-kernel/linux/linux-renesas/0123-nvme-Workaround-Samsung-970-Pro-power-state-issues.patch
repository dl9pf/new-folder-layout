Subject: [PATCH 072/122] nvme: Workaround Samsung 970 Pro power state issues

Sometimes Samsung 970 Pro NVME device just disappears.
Looks like it drops into deep sleep mode during I/O.
This behaviour has been observed at least on R-Car
Gen3 H3ULCB and M3ULC Kingfisher boards.

Add a quirk that disables deep sleep mode for the device.
