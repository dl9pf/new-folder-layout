Subject: [PATCH 21/32] ivshmem-net: Fix stuck state machine during setup

If the remote side is already in INIT state (or even higher) and has a
cached rstate of RESET, we won't make progress when signaling RESET
again because the remote side won't send a state update. Fix this by
enforcing a local check after probe completion.
