meta-gplv2
==========

This layer contains a set of recipes corresponding to old, obsolete versions of
software that are GPLv2 licensed where the upstreams have moved to GPLv3
licenses.

These were part of OE-Core until it was realised they are a ticking timebomb
with regard to security updates and general maintenance. By splitting into a
separate layer, it's hoped people realise these may not be the best solution to
the "no GPLv3 problem" and it should also make it clear there is a different
quality of service applied to these recipes.

For now, they do continue to get minimal testing by the Yocto Project, but this
will eventually be stopped, with anyone wanting to use them taking up the
maintainership.

The current maintainers for the layer are Ross Burton <ross.burton@intel.com>
and Peter Kjellerstedt <peter.kjellerstedt@axis.com>

Where to Send Patches
=====================

For now, patches should be sent to the Yocto mailing list with [meta-gplv2] in
the subject line. Before sending, be sure the patches apply cleanly to the
intended target branch of the Git repository.

    Git repository: http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi/meta-gplv2/
